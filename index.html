    Listing 20481
    =============
    Paradise found! This custom-built brand new home sits proudly on a 6.8-acre
    high wooded site overlooking a 300-acre nature conservancy. The setting is
    exceptional, and the home is every bit as exciting! A bright, open layout is
    enhanced by vaulted ceilings, hardwood and tumbled, ceramic flooring, custom
    maple cabinetry, upgraded fixtures, numerous windows, and incredible views.

    There is much more. The property includes a 40x54 storage building - perfect
    for a large boat and machinery. An exposed walkout on lower level leads down to
    a beautiful wooded area.

    An extra bathroom, bedroom, and family room can be added to the unfinished
    basement for more living space.
